2. Send those players/managers which have 5 yellow cards or 1 Red Card 5 minutes before a match starts. This must be send to an API posted here.

## Instructions

3. The API must persist the data in whatever database you feel confortable. (In case you want to use Azure contact developer@fxstreet.com to get the credentials).
4. The service should be available via a public URL. (In case you want to use Azure contact developer@fxstreet.com to get the credentials).
5. The code must be available in Github.

## Rules

1. The code must be in .net Core
2. The code must be available in GitHub

## Coding Tips

1. As department we strongly believe in following Clean Code and SOLID Principles, show us that you too.
2. We want to see your testing capabilities, despite is a CRUD web app, the second goal gives some room for it.
3. If you feel confortable you can use some DevOps tool (Azure Devops, jenkins, etc..) but is not compulsive.
